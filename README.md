# Udacity_banana_navigation
Banana navigation project for Udacity deep reinforcement learning
This learning application uses python and pytorch to solve a learning problem where the agent can turn left right and move forward or backwards to pick up bananas yellow bananas are worth 1 point and purple are worth -1. the agent has 300 steps to get a reward above 13 to consider this space solved. 
This uses the unity Ml agents to for interactions with the action space

# Getting Started 
Download the files and install the packages in the requirements.txt file also unity ml agents will need to be installed.

# Instructions 
The code to run the deep nueral net is found in the report.ipython code.
Any changes to the nueral net or the agent can be changed inside the agent1.py code
